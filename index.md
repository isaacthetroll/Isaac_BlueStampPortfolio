# Starter Project: Calculator

This starter project was a calculator, I soldered in a battery socket, usb socket, monolithic capacitor, processor socket, two digital tubes, and buttons in the circuit board. Then, I put caps on the buttons, a battery in the battery socket, and a processor in the processor socket. The only problem I encountered during this project was fitting the processor as the pins were too wide to fit in the socket. However, I just bent all the pins a little until the processor fit in the socket. The buttons tell the proccessor what to calculate and the processor tells the digital tubes what to display.

<!-- # Schematics 
Here's where you'll put images of your schematics. [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/blog/official-guide-to-tinkercad-circuits) and [Fritzing](https://fritzing.org/learning/) are both great resoruces to create professional schematic diagrams, though BSE recommends Tinkercad becuase it can be done easily and for free in the browser. 

# Code
Here's where you'll put your code. The syntax below places it into a block of code. Follow the guide [here]([url](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/)) to learn how to customize it to your project needs. 

```c++
void setup() {
  // put your setup code here, to run once:
  Serial.begin(9600);
  Serial.println("Hello World!");
}

void loop() {
  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:

}

<!-- # Other Resources/Examples
One of the best parts about Github is that you can view how other people set up their own work. Here are some past BSE portfolios that are awesome examples. You can view how they set up their portfolio, and you can view their index.md files to understand how they implemented different portfolio components.
- [Example 1](https://trashytuber.github.io/YimingJiaBlueStamp/)
- [Example 2](https://sviatil0.github.io/Sviatoslav_BSE/)
- [Example 3](https://arneshkumar.github.io/arneshbluestamp/)
